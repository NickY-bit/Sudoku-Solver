# Sudoku-Solver
Submission for MITBlueprint 2021.
This program solves sudokus one step at a time, for when you want a nudge in the right direction rather than having all the answers given to you.
Note this version can only solve "simple" sudokus where there is always at least one square with only one possible number.
